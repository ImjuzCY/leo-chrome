leo-chrome
==========

A simple Chrome extension for the [LEO dictionary](http://dict.leo.org).

You can grab it from the Chrome Web Store: [LEO Address Bar Search](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/leo-address-bar-search/lfmglodiicnghkipaijbhdmaaoomcgdd)

How does it work?
-----------------

It adds a 'leo' command to the address bar to quickly look up words in the LEO dictionary.

For example, typing "leo street" will redirect to the LEO dictionary and show the available translations for the word "street".

Supports:

* German <> English
* German <> French
* German <> Spanish
* German <> Italian
* German <> Chinese
* German <> Russian
